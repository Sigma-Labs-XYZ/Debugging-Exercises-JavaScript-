## Problem

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

### Test Examples

```js
pigIt("Pig latin is cool"); // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pigIt("Hello world !"); // elloHay orldway !
```

## Task

The code provided in the JS file is buggy. Try and use the debugging framework to fix the issues and get the code running.
