## Problem

Define a function that takes one integer argument and returns logical value `true` or `false` depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

- You can assume you will be given an integer input.
- You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well (or `0`).

### Test Examples

```js
is_prime(1); /* false */
is_prime(2); /* true  */
is_prime(-1); /* false */
```
